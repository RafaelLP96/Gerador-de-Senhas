# 🔐 Password Generator

[🇧🇷 Ler em Português](README.md)

An **interactive password generator** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, focused on customization, security, and a modern interface.  
Users can configure character types, switch between light and dark themes, and check password strength in real time.  
It’s ideal to use alongside your favorite password manager, as it generates fully random character combinations.

## 💡 Passwords Without Character or Type Repetition

This generator avoids consecutive repetition of both characters and character types, as demonstrated by **Park et al. (2023)**, who found that repetitive patterns reduce entropy and make passwords more predictable during automated attacks.
